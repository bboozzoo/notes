* ARM builds

  Make sure that the cross-compiler setup is available in $PATH,
  specifically one with the prefix used in CROSS_COMPILE.

  Quick build path:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  export ARCH=arm
  export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
  make vexpress_defconfig
  # adjust as needed
  make menuconfig
  make
  make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=<path-to-arm-sysroot> modules_install

  #+END_SRC

  Use ~qemu-system-arm -machine vexpress-a9 -dtb
  arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb~. Console is available at
  ~ttyAMA0~ on Versatile Express.
